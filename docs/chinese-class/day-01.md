It looks like you're diving into the basics of Mandarin! Based on your handwritten notes and the lecture slide, I’ve organized the content into logical categories to help you study.

## 1. Phonetic Systems

Your notes compare **Pinyin** (the Romanization used in Mainland China) and **Zhuyin/Bopomofo** (the phonetic symbols used in Taiwan).

| Pinyin | b | p | m | f | d | t | n | l |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Zhuyin** | ㄅ | ㄆ | ㄇ | ㄈ | ㄉ | ㄊ | ㄋ | ㄌ |

## 2. Basic Vocabulary & Characters

These notes show how complex characters are often built from simpler "radicals" (like the person radical in "rest").

* **<button onclick="speakSlow('人')">人 (rén):**</button> People / Person
* **<button onclick="speakSlow('木')">木 (mù):**</button> Tree / Wood
* **<button onclick="speakSlow('休')">休 (xiū):**</button> To take a rest (Literal: A *person* leaning against a *tree*)

## 4. Self-Introduction (Slide Content)

This section provides a template for introducing yourself to others.

1. **Name:** <button onclick="speakSlow('我叫')">我叫</button> + [Full Name]  
* *wǒ jiào...* (I am called...)


2. **Origin:** <button onclick="speakSlow('我來自')">我來自</button> + [Country]  
* *wǒ lái zì...* (I come from...)


3. **Polite Closing:** <button onclick="speakSlow('很高興認識你們。')">很高興認識你們。</button>

### A Quick Tip on "No":

You have **不 (bù)** at the bottom of your page.

> **Note:** In Mandarin, the tone of "bù" changes depending on the word after it. If the next word is a 4th tone (like in *bú kè qì*), "bù" changes from a falling tone to a rising tone (**bú**).

Would you like me to translate your specific country or name into Chinese so you can complete your self-introduction?
